# API v3

This is version 3 of the Fates List API and backend upon which the Fates List frontend (sunbeam) and all other services sit upon. 

*Relies on baypaw to work*

**This requires nightly rust in order to compile**

Internally known as Lightleap (also from Warrior Cats)

## TODOs (for my knowledge)

- Get Bot Filtered API (for dba etc)
